# Facial-Recognition-System
Facial recognition via EigenFaces and FisherFaces methods.
A Facial recognition system that is highly insensitive to variation in lighting direction, intensity, and facial expressions while still producing recognition results with a good level of accuracy.

Follows the algorithms in the following papers:
